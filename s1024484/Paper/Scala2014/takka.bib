In a preliminary work from G{\'e}rard Boudol, a simple type system was given that incorporates Curry's type inference for the lambda-calculus. In the present paper we study an implicit polymorphic type system, adapted from the ML typing discipline. Our typing system enjoys subject reduction and principal type properties and we give results on the complexity for the type inference problem.
