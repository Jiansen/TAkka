\abstract{This report reviews objectives and progress of my PhD project.  
Main research problems have been solved during the process of designing and 
implementing the TAkka library.  The TAkka library has been evaluated in terms 
of correctness, expressiveness, and scalability.  To help the design of 
applications with a high reliability, the TAkka library is also shipped with 
tools for debugging and monitoring purposes.

Statistic analysis shows that it is impractical to measure the reliabilities 
of a system with low failure rate.  I propose to extend the scope of this 
research to include a formal specification of supervision tree. The 
specification gives a methodology to derive the reliability of a system built 
using supervision tree from the dependencies of nodes and the reliabilities of 
individual nodes.}



\section{Project Motivation and Objectives}

The aim of this PhD project is to {\it study how types and the 
supervision principle can be merged to help the construction of reliable 
distributed systems }.  This project intends to explore factors that encourage 
programmers to employ types and good programming principles.  To this end, the 
following iterative and incremental tasks are set.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item To identify some applications implemented in Erlang or Akka using the 
supervision principles.  Those examples will be served as references to 
evaluate frameworks that support distributed programming.  Candidate examples 
shall cover a wide range of aspects in distributed programming, including but 
not limited to 
    \begin{inparaenum} [(a)]
      \item transmitting messages and potentially computation closures, 
      \item modular composition of distributed components, 
      \item default and extensible failure recovery mechanism, and
      \item dynamic topology and hot code swapping.
    \end{inparaenum}
    
  \item To implement a library, TAkka, that supports actor programming and the 
supervision principles in a strongly typed setting.  Basic components of the 
library may be built on top of Akka\citep{akka_doc} in the case that repeated 
implementation could be avoided.  Comparing to the Akka library, the new library 
should be able to prevent more forms of type errors at earlier development 
stages.
    
  \item To re-implement identified applications using the library developed in 
task 2.  The primary purpose of this task is to be aware of the strengths and 
limitations of using strongly and weakly typed supervision libraries.  As a 
research which contains certain levels of overlaps with other existing and 
evolving frameworks, this research should distinguish itself from others by 
devised solutions to some problems which are difficult to be solved by 
alternatives.

  \item To evaluate how different supervision libraries meet the demands of 
distributed programming.  This project suggests evaluating libraries with
respects to efficiency, scalability, and reliability.
\end{enumerate}


%% Progress Overview
\section{Progress Review}

The main topic of this research was set as the result of the background study 
in the first year.  During the second year, the research objectives and the 
design of the TAkka library were refined in quarterly reviews.  By the end of 
the second year, I had
\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a\upshape)]
\item implemented key components of the TAkka library;
\item proposed and implemented a novel typed nameserver that maps each typed 
symbol to typed a value of corresponding type;
\item demonstrated how to solve the type pollution problem using 
type-parameterized actor and subtyping; and 
\item proposed a methodology for evaluating libraries supporting the 
supervision principle.
\end{inparaenum} 

The third year is focused on the methodology for evaluating TAkka and other 
libraries that support the supervision principle.  In short,


\begin{itemize}
  \item The correctness and the expressiveness of the TAkka library is 
evaluated by porting a selection of small and medium sized applications written 
in Erlang and Akka.
  \item The scalability of sample applications written in TAkka and Akka is 
compared regarding to speed-up and throughput increases.  Benchmark examples 
for speed-up measurement are selected from the Bencherl project and tested on 
the Beowulf cluster at the Heriot-Watt University.  The example for throughput 
measurement is selected from the Techempower web framework benchmarks
\citep{techempower} and is tested using Amazon EC2 instances with a Load 
Balancer.
  \item The reliability of a TAkka application can be tested by using the 
ChaosMonkey library and the SupervisionView library.  A chaos monkey test 
assesses the robustness of a TAkka application by randomly kills actors.  The 
SupervisionView library can be used to monitor dynamical changes of a 
supervision tree.
\end{itemize}

The design, implementation, and evaluation of TAkka libraries are elaborated in 
the attached paper.



\section{Measuring Reliability}

Due to the nature of library development, we cannot assure the reliability of 
applications built using the supervision principle; nor the achieved high 
reliability of large Erlang applications can indicate that a newly implemented 
application using the supervision principle will have a desired reliability.  
To help software developers identifying bugs of their applications, 
the ChaosMonkey library and the SupervisionView library are shipped with TAkka. 
 However, a quantitative measurement of software reliability under operational 
environment is still desired in practice.  To solve this problem, two 
approaches are discussed in the attached research proposal.

The first approach is measuring the target system as black-box.  Unfortunately, 
\citep{Littlewood93} shows that even a long time failure-free observation 
itself does not suggest the software system will achieve a high reliability in 
the future.  I attempted to replace \citep{Littlewood93}'s single-run experiment 
by 
iterative experiment so that the required experiment time for some applications 
can be reduced.  Unfortunately, in most cases, predicting the reliability of a 
system with low failure rate is still impractical.  Therefore, I proposed the 
second approach which focuses on applications built using the supervision 
principle.

The second approach is giving a specification of actor-based supervision tree 
and measuring the reliability of a supervision tree as the accumulated result 
of reliabilities of its sub-trees. 
By eliminating language features not related to supervision, both the worker 
node and the supervisor node in a supervision tree can be modelled as  
Deterministic Finite Automata.  Analysis shows that various of
supervision trees can be modelled by a supervision tree that only contains 
simple worker node and simple supervisor node.  More importantly, the 
reliability of a node in the proposed model is simply defined as the possibility 
that the node is in its {\bf Free} state, in which it can react to a request.  
To accomplish this study, following problems need to be solved:
\begin{itemize}
  \item What are possible dependencies between nodes? For each dependency,
what is the algebraic relationship between the reliability of a sub-tree
and reliabilities of individual nodes?
  \item Based on the above result, how to calculate the overall reliabilities
of a supervision tree? When will the reliability be improved by using
supervising tree, and when will not?
  \item Given the reliabilities of individual workers and constraints between
them, is there an algorithm to give a supervision tree which gives a desired 
reliability?  If not, can we determine if the desired reliability is not
achievable?
\end{itemize}
