\section*{Acknowledgements}

This thesis is dedicated to my parents for their endless love and support.
It is also dedicated to my wife, Shiye, for her continuous encouragement
during my hard times.  Meeting my wife and getting married are the best
two things happened to me in the past 4 years.

I want to thank my supervisors, Philip Wadler, Philip Trinder and Don Sannella,
for their guidance over four years.  I am fortunate to have been supervised
by them.

I gratefully acknowledge the substantial help that have received from many 
colleagues who have shared their related results and ideas over the long period 
during which this thesis was in preparation. Benedict Kavanagh and Danel Ahman 
for continuous comments and discussions. Roland Kuhn from the Akka team for 
sharing deep insight of the the Akka design.  
The RELEASE team for giving us access to the source code of the BenchErl 
benchmark examples.  Thomas Arts from QuviQ.com and Francesco Cesarini from 
Erlang Solutions for providing the Erlang source code of two examples used 
in their commercial training courses.

\begin{abstract}

The robustness of actor-based concurrent applications can be improved upon by 
(i) employing failure recovery mechanisms such as the supervision principle, or 
(ii) using typed messages to prevent ill-typed communication. This thesis 
introduces TAkka, a typed Akka library that supports both the supervision 
principle and typed messages. The TAkka library mixes static and dynamic type 
checking to make sure that dynamically typed distributed resources and 
statically typed local resources have consistent types. Our notion of typed 
actor can publish itself as different types when used by different parties so 
that messages of unexpected types are prevented at the senders' side. In TAkka, 
messages for supervision purposes are treated in a special way so that a 
supervisor can interact with child actors of different types. Results show that 
Akka programs can be gradually upgraded to TAkka equivalents with minimal 
runtime and code size overheads. Finally, TAkka includes two auxiliary 
libraries for reliability assessment.
