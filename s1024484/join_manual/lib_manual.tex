The Scala Join Library (version 0.3) improves the scala joins library \cite{scala_joins} implemented by Haller and Cutsem.  Main advantages of this library are: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
  \item uniform $and$ operator,
  \item supporting pattern matching on messages,
  \item theoretically unlimited number of join patterns in a single block
  \item clear typed $unapply$ method in extractor objects
  \item simpler structure for the $\bf{Join}$ class, and most importantly,
  \item supporting communication on distributed join channels.
\end{inparaenum}  

\section{Using the library}
\subsection{Sending Messages via Channels}
An elementary operation in the join calculus is sending a message via a channel.  A channel could be either asynchronous or synchronous.  At caller's side, sending a message via an asynchronous channel has no obvious effect in the sense that the program will proceed immediately after sending that message.  By contrast, when a message is sent via a synchronous channel, the current thread will be suspended until a result is returned.  

To send a message $m$ via channel $c$, users simply apply the message to the channel by calling $c(m)$.  For the returned value of a synchronous channel, users may want to assign it to a variable so that it could be used later.  For example,
\begin{lstlisting}
  val v = c(m) // c is a synchronous channel
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Grouping join patterns}

A join definition defines channels and join patterns.  Users defines a join definition by initializing the $\bf{Join}$ class or its subclass.  It is often the case that a join definition (including channels and join patterns defined inside it) should be globally $\it{static}$.  If this is the case, it is a good programming practice in Scala to declare the join definition as a $\it{singleton\ object}$ with following idiom:

\begin{lstlisting}
  object join_definition_name extends Join{
    //channel declarations
    //join patterns declaration
  }
\end{lstlisting}

A channel is a singleton object inside a join definition.  It extends either class $\bf{AsyName[ARG]}$ or class $\bf{SynName[ARG,R]}$, where $\bf{ARG}$ and $\bf{R}$ are generic type parameters.  Here, $\bf{ARG}$ indicates the type of channel parameter whereas $\bf{R}$ indicates the type of return value of a synchronous channel.  The current library only supports unary channels, which only take one parameter.  Fortunately, this is sufficient for constructing nullary channels and channels that take more than one parameters.  A nullary channel could be edcoded as a channel whose argument is always $\bf{Unit}$ or any other constant.  For channel that takes more than one parameters, users could pack all arguments in a tuple.

Once a channel is defined, we can use it to define a join pattern in the following form
\begin{lstlisting}
  case <pattern> => <statements>
\end{lstlisting}

\newpage

The $\textless pattern \textgreater$ at the left hand side of $\Rightarrow$ is a set of channels and their formal arguments, connected by the infix operator $and$.  The  $\textless statements \textgreater$ at the right hand side of $\Rightarrow$ is a sequence of Scala statements.  Formal arguments declared in the  $\textless pattern \textgreater$ must be pairwise distinguished and might be used in the  $\textless statements \textgreater$ part.  In addition, each join definition accepts one and only one group of join pattens as the argument of its $join$ method.  Lastly, like most implementations for the join calculus, the library does not permit multiple useages of the same channel in a single join pattern.  On the other side, using the same channel in arbitrary number of different patterns is allowed.

We conclude this section by presenting a sample code that defines a join pattern.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=local_join_def_example, caption=Example code for defining channels and join patterns (join\_test.scala)]
import join._
import scala.concurrent.ops._ // spawn
object join_test extends App{//for scala 2.9.0 or later
  object myFirstJoin extends Join{
    object echo extends AsyName[String]
    object sq extends SynName[Int, Int]
    object put extends AsyName[Int]
    object get extends SynName[Unit, Int]

    join{
      case echo("Hello") => println("Hi")
      case echo(str)  => println(str)
      case sq(x) => sq reply x*x
      case put(x) and get(_) => get reply x
   }
  }

  spawn {
    val sq3 = myFirstJoin.sq(3)
    println("square (3) = "+sq3)
  }
  spawn { println("get: "+myFirstJoin.get()) }
  spawn { myFirstJoin.echo("Hello"), myFirstJoin.echo("Hello World") }
  spawn { myFirstJoin.put(8) }
}
\end{lstlisting}
One possible result of running above code is:
\begin{lstlisting}
>scalac join_test.scala
>scala join_test
square (3) = 9
Hi
Hello World
get: 8
\end{lstlisting}



\subsection{Distributed computation}


With the distributed join library, it is easy to construct distributed systems on the top of a local system.  This section explains additional constructors in the distributed join library by looking into the code of a simple client-server system, which calculates the square of an integer on request.  The server side code is given at Listing \ref{dis_server} and the client side code is given at Listing \ref{dis_client}.

\newpage

\begin{lstlisting}[label=dis_server, caption=Server.scala]
import join._
object Server extends App{
  val port = 9000
  object join extends DisJoin(port, 'JoinServer){
    object sq extends SynName[Int, Int]
    join{      case sq(x) => println("x:"+x); sq reply x*x    }
    registerChannel("square", sq)
  }
  join.start()
}
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[label=dis_client, caption=Client.scala]
object Client{
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val server = DisJoin.connect("myServer", 9000, 'JoinServer)
    //val c = new DisSynName[Int, String]("square", server)
    //java.lang.Error: Distributed channel initial error: 
            Channel square does not have type Int => java.lang.String.
    //...
    val c = new DisSynName[Int, Int]("square", server)//pass
    val x = args(0).toInt
    val sqr = c(x)
    println("sqr("+x+") = "+sqr)
    exit()
}}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
> scala ServerTest                                    
Server 'JoinServer Started...
							>scala Client 5
x:5
							sqr(5) = 25
							>scala Client 7
x:7
							sqr(7) = 49
\end{lstlisting}


In Server.scala, we constructed a distributed join definition by extending class \\ $\bf{DisJoin(Int, Symbol)}$.  The integer is the port number where the join definition is going to listen and the symbol is used to identify the join definition.  The way to declare channels and join patterns in $\bf{DisJoin}$ is the same as the way in $\bf{Join}$.  In addition, we register channels which might be used at remote site with a memorizable string.  At last, different from running a local join definition, a distributed join definition has to be explicitly started.

In Client.scala, we connect to the server by calling DisJoin.connect.  The first and second arguments are the hostname and port number where the remote join definition is located.  The last argument is the name of the distributed join definition.  The hostname is a String which is used for local name server to resolve the IP address of a remote site.  The port number and the name of join definition should be exactly the same as the specification of the distributed join definition.

Once the distributed join definition, server, is successfully connected, we can initialize distributed channels as an instance of DisAsyName[ARG](channel\_name, server) or DisSynName[ARG, R](channel\_name, server).  Using an unregistered channel name or declaring a distributed channel whose type is inconsistent with  its referring local channel will raise a run-time exception as soon as the distributed channel is initialised.  In later parts of program, the client is free to use distributed channels to communicate with the remote server.  The way to invoke distributed channels and local channels are same.

\section{Implementation Details}
\subsection{Case Statement, Extractor Objects and Pattern Matching in Scala}

In Scala, a partial function is a function with an additional method: $isDefinedAt$, which will return $true$ if the argument is in the domain of this partial function, or $false$ otherwise.  The easiest way to define a partial function is using the case statement.  For example,

\begin{lstlisting}
scala> val myPF : PartialFunction[Int,String] = {
     |  case 1 => "myPF apply 1"
     | }
myPF: PartialFunction[Int,String] = <function1>

scala> myPF.isDefinedAt(1)
res1: Boolean = true

scala> myPF.isDefinedAt(2)
res2: Boolean = false

scala> myPF(1)            
res3: String = myPF apply 1

scala> myPF(2)            
scala.MatchError: 2
	at $anonfun$1.apply(<console>:5)
	...
\end{lstlisting}

In addition to instances of a numerate class and case classes, the value used between $case$ and $\Rightarrow$ could also be an instance of an $\it{extractor\ object}$, object that contains an $unapply$ method\cite{extractors}.  For example,

\begin{lstlisting}
scala> object Even {
     |   def unapply(z: Int): Option[Int] = if (z%2 == 0) Some(z/2) else None
     | }
defined module Even

scala>   42 match { case Even(n) => Console.println(n) } // prints 21
21

scala>   41 match { case Even(n) => Console.println(n) } // prints 21
scala.MatchError: 41
	...
\end{lstlisting}

In the above example, when a value, say $x$, attempts to match against a pattern, $Even(n)$, the method $Even.unapply(x)$ is invoked.  If $Even.unapply(x)$ returns $Some(v)$, then the formal argument $n$ will be assigned with the value $v$ and statements at the right hand side of $\Rightarrow$ will be executed.  By contrast, if $Even.unapply(x)$ returns $None$, then the current case statement is considered not matching the input value, and the pattern examination will move towards the next case statement.  If the last case statement still does not match the input value, then the whole partial function is not defined for the input.  Applying a value outside the domain of a partial function will rise a $\it{MatchError}$.

\newpage
\subsection{Implementing local channels}
\label{imp_loc_join}
Both asynchronous channel and synchronous channel are subclass of trait $NameBase$.  The reason why we introduced this implementation free trait is that, although using generic types to restrict the type of messages pending on a specific channel is important for type safety, a uniform view for asynchronous and synchronous channels simplifies the implementation at many places.  For example, the three methods listed in Listing \ref{local_name_base} are common between those two kinds of channels and are important for the implementation of Join and DisJoin class.

\begin{lstlisting} [label=local_name_base, caption=Super Class for AsyName and SynName]
trait NameBase{  
  def argTypeEqual(t:Any):Boolean
  def pendArg(arg:Any):Unit
  def popArg():Unit
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting} [label=local_asy_ch, caption=Code defines local asynchronous channel]
class AsyName[Arg](implicit owner: Join, argT:ClassManifest[Arg]) extends NameBase{
  var argQ = new Queue[Arg] //queue of arguments pending on this name

  override def pendArg(arg:Any):Unit = {
    argQ += arg.asInstanceOf[Arg]
  }

  def apply(a:Arg) :Unit = synchronized { 
    if(argQ.contains(a)){  argQ += a  }
    else{
      owner.trymatch(this, a)  // see if the new message will trigger any pattern
    }
  //other code
}
\end{lstlisting}

Asynchronous channel is implemented as Listing \ref{local_asy_ch}.  The implicit argument $owner$ is the join definition where the channel is defined.  The other implicit argument, $\bf{argT}$, is the descriptor for the run time type of $\bf{Arg}$.  Although $\bf{argT}$ is a duplicate information for $\bf{Arg}$, it is important for distributed channels, whose erased type parameter might be declared differently between different sites.  We postponed this problem until  \S\ref{imp_dis_join}.

As shown in the above code, an asynchronous channel contains an argument queue whose element must has generic type $\bf{Arg}$.  Sending a message via a channel is achieved by calling its $apply$ method, so that c(m) could be wrote instead of c.apply(m) for short in Scala.   Based on the linear assumption that no channel should appear more than once in a join pattern, reduction is possible only when a new message value is pending on a channel.  Therefore, new message that has the same value as another pending message should be attached to the end of the message queue.  On the other hand, if the message contains a new value, the join definition will be notified to perform a pattern checking.

\begin{lstlisting} [label=local_syn_ch, caption=Code defines local synchronous channel]
class SynName[Arg, R](implicit owner: Join, argT:ClassManifest[Arg], resT:ClassManifest[R])
 extends NameBase{
  var argQ = new Queue[Arg]
  var msgTag = new SyncVar[Arg]
  var resultQ = new Queue[(Arg, R)]

  def apply(a:Arg) :R =  synchronized {
    if(argQ.contains(a)){  argQ += a  }
    else{  owner.trymatch(this, a)  }
    fetch(a)
  }
  
  def reply(r:R):Unit = spawn {synchronized {
    resultQ.enqueue((msgTag.get, r))
    notifyAll()
  }}

  private def fetch(a:Arg):R = synchronized {
    if (resultQ.isEmpty || resultQ.front._1 != a){
      wait(); fetch(a)
    }else{
      resultQ.dequeue()._2
    }
  }

  //other code
}
\end{lstlisting}

As listing \ref{local_syn_ch} shows, in addition to fire a pattern or pend a message to the message queue, an invocation on synchronous channel also needs to return a result value to the message sender.  Since many senders may be waiting for a return value at the same time, for each reply invocation, the library need to work out which message the a result reply to.  To this end, the library uses msgTag to store the message that matches current fireable pattern.  When a reply method is called, the channel insert a pair of message and its reply to the result queue and notify all fetch threads that are waiting for a reply.  With the help of the synchronized method of Scala Object, only one thread could attempt to fetch the reply value at a time.


\subsection{Implementing the join pattern using extractor objects}

\subsubsection{The unapply method for local synchronous channel}

In this library, join patterns are represented as a partial function.  To support join patterns and pattern matching on message values, the library provides the unapply method for local channels.  The unapply method for synchronous channel is given in Listing \ref{unapply_ch}.    The unapply method for asynchronous channel is almost the same as the synchronous version, except that it does not need to set message tag. 

Listing \ref{unapply_ch_core} gives the core of the unapply method of synchronous channel.  The five parameters sent to the unapply method are:

\begin{enumerate} [(i)]
  \item $nameset$: channels that could trigger the first fireable pattern.
  \item $pattern$: the join pattern itself.
  \item $fixedMsg$: a map from channels to corresponding values.  If the current channel is a key of the map, the unapply method return the mapping value of the current channel.
  \item $tag$: an integer indicates the depth of pattern matching.  The $tag$ is useful for some optimizations and debugging.
  \item $bandedName$: a banded channel name.  If the current channel is the same as the $bandedName$, the unapply method returns None.
\end{enumerate}

When a channel is asked to select a message that could trigger a $pattern$, it first check rule (iii) and (v).  If neither rule applies, the channel returns the first message that matches the pattern and add this channel to the $nameset$, if such a message exists.  We consider a channel message pair triggers a join pattern if the join pattern cannot be fired without the presence of message on the current channel and will be fired when the message value is bound to the current channel.

\begin{lstlisting} [label=unapply_ch_core, caption=Core of the unapply method of local synchronous channel]
case (nameset: Set[NameBase], pattern:PartialFunction[Any, Any], 
           fixedMsg:HashMap[NameBase, Any], tag:Int, banedName:NameBase) => {
        //other code
        if (this == banedName) {return None}      
        if(fixedMsg.contains(this)){
          Some(fixedMsg(this).asInstanceOf[Arg])
        }else{
        
          def matched(m:Arg):Boolean = {
          // optimization code
          
          //     pattern cannot be fired without the presence of message on current channel  
          //and  pattern can be fired when m is bound to the current channel 
                (!(pattern.isDefinedAt(nameset, pattern, fixedMsg+((this, m)), tag+1, this))
          && (pattern.isDefinedAt((nameset, pattern, fixedMsg+((this, m)), tag+1, banedName))))
          }
                
        var returnV:Option[Arg] = None

        argQ.span(m => !matched(m)) match {
           case (_, MutableList()) => { // no message pending on this channel may trigger the pattern
             returnV = None
           }
           case (ums, ms) => {
             val arg = ms.head // the message could trigger a pattern
             nameset.add(this)
             setMsgTag(arg)
             returnV = Some(arg)
           }
        }
        returnV
      }
}
\end{lstlisting}

The above core implementation be improved for better efficiency.  Firstly, if the value of a message has been proved would not trigger the join pattern, the matched method invoked by the span iteration do not need to run complex test for that value.  To this end, the library introduces a HashSet $checkedMsg$ to record checked message values but clear the set after the span iteration.  Secondly, when a message is selected, popping it to the head of the message queue saves the later work of removing that message from the queue.  Lastly, each channel that triggers a pattern only needs to be added to the $nameset$ once.  Although inserting an element to a hashset is relative cheap, the cost could be further reduced to the cost of comparing two integers.  The full implementation for the unapply methods of synchronous channel is given at Listing \ref{unapply_ch}.  The first case statement is used for improving the efficiency of code involving singleton pattern, where a pattern only contains one channel.  More explanation will be given in the next section.
 
\begin{lstlisting} [label=unapply_ch, caption=The unapply method of local synchronous channel]
  def unapply(attr:Any) : Option[Arg]= attr match { // for pattern matching
    case (ch:NameBase, arg:Any) => {
      if(ch == this){
        Some(arg.asInstanceOf[Arg])
      }else{
        None
      }
    }
    case (nameset: Set[NameBase], pattern:PartialFunction[Any, Any], 
           fixedMsg:HashMap[NameBase, Any], tag:Int, banedName:NameBase) => {
      if (this == banedName) {return None}      
      if(fixedMsg.contains(this)){
        Some(fixedMsg(this).asInstanceOf[Arg])
      }else{        
        var checkedMsg = new HashSet[Arg]
        
        def matched(m:Arg):Boolean = {
          if (checkedMsg(m)) {false} // the message has been checked
          else {
            checkedMsg += m
            (!(pattern.isDefinedAt(nameset, pattern, fixedMsg+((this, m)), tag+1, this))
            && (pattern.isDefinedAt((nameset, pattern, fixedMsg+((this, m)), tag+1, banedName))))
          }
        }
        
        var returnV:Option[Arg] = None
        argQ.span(m => !matched(m)) match {
           case (_, MutableList()) => {
             returnV = None
           }
           case (ums, ms) => {
             val arg = ms.head
             argQ = (((ums.+=:( arg )) ++ ms.tail).toQueue)
             if(tag == 1) {nameset.add(this)}
             setMsgTag(arg)
             returnV = Some(arg)
           }
        }
        checkedMsg.clear
        returnV
      }
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{The $Join$ class and the $and$ object}
As said in earlier section, join patterns are represented as a partial function in this library.  An instance of the Join class are responsible for storing the join definition and attempting fire a pattern on request.  If the requested channel message association could fire a pattern, all channels involved in that pattern will be asked to removed the matched message;  otherwise, the channel will be notified to pend the message to its message queue.

Although this library encouraging using join patterns as a connivence constructor to synchronizing resources, actor model is popular at the time of implementing this library and not all channels need to be synchronized with others.  For this reason, this library gives singleton patterns the privilege on pattern examination.  Readers may wonder to what extend the efficiency will be affected by the above decision.  To answer this question, consider a typical join definition where $p$ patterns are defined and there are $m$ channels on each pattern.  At the time of a new message is arrived, there are $n$ messages pending on each channel on average.  On average, this library needs $O(p)$ time to check all patterns as if they are singleton patterns before spending $O(pmn)$ time to checking all patterns as join patterns.  Therefore, the additional checking will not significantly increase the cost of checking join patterns but will benefits programs that use lots of singleton patterns.  Empirical evidence will be given in \S\ref{efficiency}.

\newpage
\begin{lstlisting} [label=code_join, caption=Code defines the Join class]
class Join {
  private var hasDefined = false
  implicit val joinsOwner = this
  
  private var joinPat: PartialFunction[Any, Any] = _

  def join(joinPat: PartialFunction[Any, Any]) { 
   if(!hasDefined){
     this.joinPat = joinPat
     hasDefined = true
   }else{
     throw new Exception("Join definition has been set for"+this)
   }
  }
   
  def trymatch(ch:NameBase, arg:Any) = synchronized {
    var names: Set[NameBase] = new HashSet
    try{
      if(joinPat.isDefinedAt((ch, arg))){// checking singleton patterns
        if(ch.isInstanceOf[SynName[Any, Any]]) {ch.asInstanceOf[SynName[Any,Any]]setMsgTag(arg)}
        joinPat((ch,arg))
      }else{
        if(ch.isInstanceOf[SynName[Any, Any]]){
          joinPat((names, this.joinPat, (new HashMap[NameBase, Any]+((ch, arg))), 1, new SynName))            
          ch.asInstanceOf[SynName[Any,Any]].setMsgTag(arg)          
        }else{
          joinPat((names, this.joinPat, (new HashMap[NameBase, Any]+((ch, arg))), 1, new AsyName))
        }
        names.foreach(n => {
          if(n != ch) n.popArg
        })
      }
    }catch{
      case e:MatchError => ch.pendArg(arg)// no pattern is matched
    }
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}


To investigate how extractor objects is used to implement join patterns, first consider a join pattern that only contains a single channel, for example, 

\begin{lstlisting}
  case ch(msg) => println("received message "+msg+" from channel "+ch) 
\end{lstlisting}

The last thing is to define an $and$ constructor which combines two or more channels in a join pattern.  Indeed, this is surprisingly simple to some extent.  In the library, $and$ is defined as a binary operator which passes the same argument to both operands.

\begin{lstlisting} [label=unapply_and, caption=Code defines the and object]
object and{
  def unapply(attr:Any) = {
      Some(attr,attr)
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Implementing distributed join calculus}
\label{imp_dis_join}

The $\bf{DisJoin}$ class extends both the $\bf{Join}$ class, which supports join definitions, and the $\bf{Actor}$ traits, which enables distributed communication.  In addition, the distributed join definition manages a name server which maps a string to one of its channels.  Comparing to a local join definition, a distributed join definition has two additional tasks: checking if distributed channels used at a remote sites are annotated with correct types and listening messages pending on distributed channels.  The code of the $\bf{DisJoin}$ class is presented in Listing $\ref{code_disjoin}$.


\begin{lstlisting} [label=code_disjoin, caption=Code defines the DisJoin Class]
class DisJoin(port:Int, name: Symbol) extends Join with Actor{
  var channelMap = new HashMap[String, NameBase]   //work as name server
  
  def registerChannel(name:String, ch:NameBase){
    assert(!channelMap.contains(name), name+" has been registered.")
    channelMap += ((name, ch))
  }  
  
  def act(){
    RemoteActor.classLoader = getClass().getClassLoader()
    alive(port)
    register(name, self)//
    println("Server "+name+" Started...")
    
    loop(
      react{
        case JoinMessage(name, arg:Any) =>  {
          if (channelMap.contains(name)) {
            channelMap(name) match {
              case n : SynName[Any, Any] => sender ! n(arg)
              case n : AsyName[Any] => n(arg)
         }}}

        case SynNameCheck(name, argT, resT) => {
          if (channelMap.contains(name)) {
            sender ! (channelMap(name).argTypeEqual((argT,resT)))
          }else{
            sender ! NameNotFound
          }
        }
        case AsyNameCheck(name, argT) => {
          if (channelMap.contains(name)) {
            sender ! (channelMap(name).argTypeEqual(argT))
          }else{
            sender ! NameNotFound
       }}}
    )
}}

In this library, distributed channel is indeed a stub of a remote local channel.  When a distributed channel is initialized, its signature is checked at the place where its referring local channel is defined.  Later, when a message is sent through this distributed channel, the message and the channel name is forwarded to the remote join definition where the  referring local channel is defined.  Consistent with the semantic of distributed join calculus, reduction, if any, is performed at the location where the join pattern is defined.  If the channel is a distributed synchronous channel, a reply value will be send back to the remote caller.  Listing \ref{code_dissynname} illustrates how distributed synchronous channel is implemented.  Distributed asynchronous channel is implemented in a similar way.  


\begin{lstlisting} [label=code_dissynname, caption=Code defines distributed synchronous channel]
class DisSynName[Arg:Manifest, R:Manifest](n:String, owner:scala.actors.AbstractActor){
  val argT = implicitly[ClassManifest[Arg]]//type of arguments
  val resT = implicitly[ClassManifest[R]]//type of return value
  
  initial()// type checking etc.
  
  def apply(arg:Arg) :R = synchronized {
    (owner !? JoinMessage(n, arg)).asInstanceOf[R]
  }
  
  //check type etc.
  def initial() = synchronized {
    (owner !? SynNameCheck(n, argT, resT)) match {
      case true => Unit
      case false => throw new Error("Distributed channel initial error:"+
                                        "Channel " + n + " does not have type "+
                                        argT+ " => "+resT+".")
      case NameNotFound => throw new Error("name "+n+" is not found at "+owner)
}}}
\end{lstlisting}

Lastly, the library also provides a function that simplifies the work of connection to a distributed join definition.

\begin{lstlisting}
object DisJoin {
  def connect(addr:String, port:Int, name:Symbol):AbstractActor = {
    val peer = Node(addr, port)//location of the server
    RemoteActor.select(peer, name)
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Efficiency Tests}
\label{efficiency}

In this section we provide empirical support for the claims that (a) when all patterns only contains one channel, our implementation is as efficient as the implementation for the actor model in Scala and Erlang, and (b) the efficiency of examining join patterns is competitive with JoCaml, a special purpose language for join patterns.

To verify claim (a), we ported the Scala  actor implementation for the download benchmark  \cite{DownloadBench} to Erlang and Scala Join library.  The program constructed three agents: DownloadActor, IndexActor, and WriteActor.  Users send $N$ requests to the Download Actor.  For each request the Download Actor generate a message and send the message to the IndexActor.  The IndexActor further forward the message to the WriteActor.  In total, there will be $3N$ messages will be transmitted.

To verify claim (b), we set 4 counters and define a join definition as listed above.  We use ScalaCheck \cite{ScalaCheck} as a tool to generate random messages.  Some decisions are made for this tests.  Firstly, since the JoCaml application only accepts messages defined in the join definition, we only generate messages from the 9 possible forms.  Secondly, as messages must be spawned in separate threads in JoCaml, we are only able to use the overall runtime of the jocamlrun process as an indirect measure of the time for pattern examination.  Accordingly, we measure the overall runtime of the java process as the corresponding measurements in the Scala Join tests.  Thirdly, to reduce the effects of message generator, we randomly generated 10000 messages as identical static information for both tests.  Unfortunately, as the Scala platform has an limit for the length of the method body, we are only able to run tests up to 6000 messages.  

\begin{lstlisting}
  var c1 = 0
  var c2 = 0
  var c3 = 0
  var c4 = 0
  
  object join extends Join{  
    object A extends AsyName[Int]  
    object B extends AsyName[Int]
    object C extends AsyName[Int]
    object D extends AsyName[Int]
    object E extends AsyName[Int]
    
    join {
     case A(1) and B(1) =>  { c1 += 1 }
     case C(2) and B(2) and D(2) =>  { c2 += 1 }
     case B(3) and D(3) and E(3) =>  { c3 += 1 }
     case E(4)=>  { c4 += 1 }
    }
  // other code
\end{lstlisting}



Finally, to test the scalability of the Scala Join library, we modify test (b) and ask the program to generate more random messages at run time.  In this test, we only measure the time spending on message generation and pattern examination.

\section{Limitations and Future Improvements}
\subsection{Assumption on Linear Pattern}
As most of implementations that support join patterns, this library assumes that channels in each join pattern are pairwise distinct.  Nevertheless, the current prototype implementation does not check the linear assumption for better simplicity.  

\subsection{Efficiency on Pattern Examination}
As tests in the last section shows, the efficiency of pattern examination in the JoCaml language is about five times of ours.  

\subsection{Limited number of patterns in a single join definition}
Due to the limitation of the Scala compiler <reference>, the library also has an upper limit for the number of patterns and the number of channels in each pattern.  Although the pattern of the limitation is not clear, the writer observed that a ``sorted" join-definition may support more patterns.

For example,
\begin{lstlisting}
 case A(1) and B(1) and C(1) => println(1)
 case A(2) and B(2) and D(2) => println(2)
\end{lstlisting}
is a ``better" join-definition than
\begin{lstlisting}
 case A(1) and B(1) and C(1) => println(1)
 case D(2) and B(2) and A(2) => println(2)
\end{lstlisting}
The compiler error: "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space" usually indicates the above limitation.

\subsection{Unnatural Usages of Synchronous Channels}

Users of the current library may define a join-definition like follows
\begin{lstlisting}
// bad join definition
object myjoin extends Join{
 object A extends AsyName[Int]
 object S extends SynName[Int, Int]
 join {
   case A(1) => S reply 2
   case S(n) => println("Hello World")
 }
}
\end{lstlisting}

In addition to the linear assumption, the current library further assumes that:
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
  \item  the action part only reply values to synchronous channels that appeared in the left hand side of "=>" (first pattern in the above example is invalid)
  \item all synchronous channels in a pattern, in any, will receive one and only one value if the pattern is fired  (second pattern in the above example is invalid)
\end{inparaenum}

For assumption (i), we think that all invocations on synchronous channels are expecting a reply value.  Unlike some other libraries such as C$\omega$. this library permit multiple synchronous channels in a single pattern.  For assumption (ii), the writer assumes that a program only needs to send a reply value to a synchronous channel on request.

Violating any of the above assumptions may be accepted by the system but usually cause deadlock or wrong behavior at run time.

\subsection{Type of the join pattern and the unapply methods}
As an implementation in a static typed language, users would expected a clear type for the join pattern and the unapply methods in AsyName and SynName.  If the partial function has type $T => Unit$, then the unapply methods for $AsyName[Arg]$ and $SynName[Arg, R]$ should have type $T => Option[Arg]$.  The unusual of passing partial function to the unapply methods indicates that $T$ is a recursive type.  Furthermore, due to the optimization for singleton patterns, $T$ is also a Either type.  

For earnest readers, $T$ is $\forall T.Either[(NameBase, Any), (HashSet[NameBase], PartialFunction[T, Unit]), $
$HashMap[NameBase, Any], Int, NameBase]$.  Defining such an complex data type in a separate place may not be more helpful for readers of our code than presenting the type in each case statement.  Moreover, general users do not need to understand this complex type to use the library.  For above reasons, we simply give assign $T$ the $Any$ Type and manually check type consistence of our implementation.
